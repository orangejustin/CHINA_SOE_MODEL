# CHINA_SOE_MODEL
This repository contains code for the CHINA_SOE_MODEL, a Python implementation of a model for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in China. The model is intended to be used for scenario analysis, allowing users to explore different potential scenarios for SOE operations and financial performance.

The main file in the repository is Modeling.py, which contains the implementation of the SOE model. The soeModel class defined in this file contains methods for preprocessing data, translating column names and values, correcting data types, and performing scenario analysis.

The raw data directory contains the raw data files used by the model, including data on power sales, power costs, and electricity costs.

To use the CHINA_SOE_MODEL, you can instantiate an instance of the soeModel class and call its methods to preprocess the data, translate column names and values, correct data types, and perform scenario analysis. The scenario method allows you to specify the type of scenario you want to explore, as well as various parameters related to coal prices, power generation, and other factors.
